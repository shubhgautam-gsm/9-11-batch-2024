<p>Multiple statements on one line are allowed.</p>
<!-- a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b; -->
<p>
    JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.
    The following lines are equivalent:
    var a = 5; var b = 6; var c = a + b;
</p>
<p>
    A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):

    JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
    For best readability, programmers often like to
    avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.
