# Python provide us various inbuilt functions like range() or print(). Although, the user
# can create its functions, which can be called user-defined functions.

# There are mainly two types of functions.
# User-define functions - The user-defined functions are those define by the user to
# perform the specific task.

# Built-in functions - The built-in functions are those functions that are pre-defined in
# Python.
# In this tutorial, we will discuss the user define functions.
