Control the amount of data to read: You specify 10
because you want to read the first 10 bytes (or characters)
of the file. This can be useful if you need to process the
file in chunks or if you're just interested in a small part
of the file.

Efficiency: Reading the file in chunks (e.g., 10 bytes at a time) 
can be more efficient when dealing with large files, instead of 
loading the entire file into memory all at once.
